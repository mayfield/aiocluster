aiocluster
========
Tools and frameworks classes for building your own asyncio cluster.  A cluster
in this case is a network of nodes (unique computers/containers) and workers
within those nodes (processes).

Each node can be made aware of other nodes using a discovery mechanism not
covered by this service.  For example a static list of IP/port tuples can be
provided to each node so they are capable of communicating with each other.
More advanced discovery techniques are encouraged for more scalable
applications, such as multicast/broadcast, DNS, consul, or AWS API depending
on your environment and needs.
